                <h1 class="title">Happy Birthday my love!</h1>
                <p class="content">I know this is not much, but I really hope you will appreciate this small website I
                    made.
                    Before everything, I just want to say that I, along with all of your friends, love you so much, and
                    we
                    all know that you will achieve good things in life. <br><br><br>

                    Happy twenty-one years baby! I just want to say that first and foremost, I am really really grateful
                    to
                    have you
                    as my girlfriend. You have been the most supportive, caring and loving girlfriend. You also have
                    been the
                    strongest person I've ever known. You go through each day, na kahit minsan maraming nangyayaring
                    panget, nagagawa mo pa rin maging masaya, na you always look for the bright things in life.
                    <br><br><br>

                    You keep telling me that I have been your source of strength, I would even go to say that it's the
                    complete opposite. You have been my biggest source of strength. Seeing you care so much for our
                    relationship, putting in all the love that you can into our relationship, it motivates me a lot to
                    be
                    more invested, and it gives me a calm feeling in me that tells me you are really here to stay.
                    <br><br><br>

                    I know these past few weeks haven't been the easiest for you, and I just want to say that I am
                    really
                    sorry for that. I admit that I haven't been the easiest to handle these past few weeks. I have been
                    distracted, haven't been asking too much questions, and this made you feel that I was not invested,
                    and
                    for that I am really sorry. I will do my best to show you that I am all-in for our relationship. I
                    will
                    do
                    my best to show you the love and care that you deserve. I will do my best to make you feel heard,
                    make
                    you feel loved, and make you feel like the happiest person ever. <br><br><br>

                    You have been my greatest source of inspiration. I am sure others feel the same way too. I am not
                    sure
                    if I already told you, but to be honest, you were the one that inspired me to start my fitness
                    journey.
                    Seeing you really committed to working out that summer of twenty-twenty and twenty-twenty-one made
                    me
                    feel motivated to start
                    my own fitness journey. I owe a lot of my fitness progress to you. Thank you so much. <br><br><br>

                    I also owe a lot to you in terms of my academic and non-academic progress. Seeing you putting your
                    all
                    in school and non-school activities motivated me to push myself even harder. To become a better
                    version
                    of myself. You inspired me to work on myself to become better. <br><br><br>

                    By the time you're reading this, it will be one day before our twenty-first monthsary, which I would
                    say
                    is a really fitting number, since you are turning twenty-one :P. Over these past twenty-one months,
                    I
                    have seen you grow to become a more loving, kind, and honest person. You have grown to become a
                    person
                    that I am sure will reach far places in life. You are hard-working; you always make sure to make
                    your
                    tasks in time, and with quality. You strive to get what you want, even if that means spending a lot
                    of
                    hours learning and refining that specific work to the best you can. You make sure that you have a
                    balanced time between your friends, family, schoolworks and me. Those are qualities of a really good
                    person, and I just want to say that I am really proud of the person you have become. <br><br><br>

                    There are many more things that make me really proud of you. You have been the hardest working
                    person I have ever known. Alam ko na sa mga nagagawa mo sa buhay, hindi ka papayag gumawa ng bagay
                    ng alam mong hindi sapat sa standard mo. And sobrang nagiging worth it in the end, mas lalo na you
                    have been getting scholarships and rewards. You are the president of your org, for heaven's sake,
                    grabe as in sobra akong proud to know na kahit hindi siya academic related, ginagawa mo pa rin yung
                    best mo. I am sure that your parents are really proud of you too.<br><br><br>

                    Hindi lang yun hehe, alam na alam ko na you are a really good friend to everyone around you. You are
                    willing to listen and understand your friends na kahit meron ka na sarili mong problema hinaharap sa
                    buhay, nagagawa mo pa ring maging there for them. You also give a lot to your friends. Whether that
                    be gifts, or the gift of your time, you are always willing to be there for them. Alam kong simula
                    palang to ng buhay mo, and sobrang dami mo na naachieve on a lot of aspects of your life. I am sure
                    na you will achieve way much more in life. <br><br><br>

                    You are also one of the most family-oriented people I have ever known. You make sure to always bring
                    pasalubong to your parents, and always make sure to let them know na you're safe. You also make sure
                    to spend time of your day with them, and you also always are willing to do errands for them no
                    matter how tired you are. <br><br><br>

                    Twenty-one's a really special time. This signifies the start of something wonderful. We are just
                    getting started in life, and you already have achieved so much. I am really confident na you'll be
                    able to achieve all your dreams in life. We are very very proud of you baby :) <br><br><br>

                    I am really excited to see you grow more as a person. Always remember that I will be here for you
                    every
                    step of the way. Through good days and bad, through thick and thin, I love you so much baby.
